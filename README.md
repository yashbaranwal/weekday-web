This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]

## Getting Started

First, to install all necessary packages run the command:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## 
Functionality: To achieve the same functionalities, we need to have more rest APIs.
As it's not a good & optimised solution to handle filters with a few data only.
It should hit an API with all selected filters and will get all results.

## 
Code Quality: 
Well structured, readable & maintenable.
Components have been written on components folder.
And other UI component for reusability & maintenanince are written on components/ui which are collections of shadcn.

## 
User Interface: Added the infinity funcitonality while adding a skeleton.

## 
Responsiveness: It works best on mobile, desktop & tablets.
Moreover I've added a useDevice hook under hooks to check the device and add the functionality accordingly.
